This is an example protocol designed to teach you how this stuff works.

The class name tells the code generator what .h and .c to generate. Use
the same name as you're using for this .xml file. The header/source values
provide the relative location for these two output files. Default is "."

The signature is put into every protocol message and lets us filter bogus
or unknown protocols. It is a 4-bit number from 0 to 15. Use a unique value
for each protocol you write, at least.

<include filename = "license.xml" />

You can define constants. These are put into the header file, prefixed by
the class name, so e.g. #define ZPROTO_EXAMPLE_VERSION  1

<define name = "VERSION" value = "1" />

If you define a grammar block, the BNF generator outputs this before doing
individual messages. Otherwise it generates something not entirely random.

You can optionally define a header that will be repeated at the start of
every message. This is just a kind of macro.

<header>
    <field name = "sequence" type = "number" size = "2">
        <test>123</test>
    </field>
</header>

The protocol consists of one or more 'messages', each consisting of one or
more 'fields'. The protocol messages get unique IDs. You can specify your
own IDs, as we do in the following example messages.

A field has a type and possibly a size. zcodec insists that a field with a
given name have the same type and size anywhere you use it in a protocol.
This keeps your APIs and grammars sane.

There are a few ways to version a protocol. You could use a version number
in the header. You could add it to the first message in a conversation, as
FILEMQ does.

The best way to avoid lots of breaking changes in a protocol is to split
the fields into those that rarely change, and those that often change, and
to put the second lot into hash tables (the 'hash' type).

OK, let's see some meat.

<message
    name = "LOG"
    id = "1"
    digest = "B90F4926D4662B319C0EC113794B0F27D9336A23"
    >
    <field name = "version" type = "number" size = "2" value = "3">
        Version
    </field>
    <field name = "level" type = "number" size = "1">
        Log severity level
        <test>2</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "event" type = "number" size = "1">
        Type of event
        <test>3</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "node" type = "number" size = "2">
        Sending node
        <test>45536</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "peer" type = "number" size = "2">
        Refers to this peer
        <test>65535</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "time" type = "number" size = "8">
        Log date/time
        <test>1427261426</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "host" type = "string">
        Originating hostname
        <test>localhost</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "data" type = "longstr">
        Actual log message
        <test>This is the message to log</test>
    </field>
Log an event.
</message>

Note that you can add a short comment for each field, and for the message.
Use these, it helps when reading the source code.

zproto supports numbers (unsigned integers) of 1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes. If you
don't specify the size, it's 1 byte by default.

zproto supports strings encoded as length + data, in the proper ZeroMQ style,
without trailing nulls or any of that language-specific stuff. The length can
be 1 (string) or 4 (longstr). Strings (short and long) are shown to the API
as char *.

Strings contain UTF-8 data; that is, no zero bytes. Their encoded size is the
number of bytes in the string (not including the size field).

On number and string fields you can define a 'value' property. This will be
stamped into messages as a constant, and checked on read messages. You can
use this for e.g. version detection.

zproto supports lists and hashes of strings:

<message
    name = "STRUCTURES"
    id = "2"
    digest = "52D9E295862BC3EDAD2841C412327A50D2C1B857"
    >
    <field name = "aliases" type = "strings">
        List of strings
        <test>First alias</test>
        <test>Second alias</test>
        <test>Third alias</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "headers" type = "hash">
        Other random properties
        <test key = "endpoint">tcp://localhost:5665</test>
    </field>
This message contains a list and a hash.
</message>

You should read the zproto_example.h file quite carefully to see what API
these field types generate.

zproto supports several kinds of binary data:

* You can define a raw octet block of fixed size, which is a byte * in
  the API. You can use this to encode short binary fields. Do not use
  for anything longer than e.g. 256 octets.

* You can define chunks, which are zchunk_t objects in the API. Chunks
  are encoded like longstr fields, a 4-octet length and a body.

* You can define uuids, which are zuuid_t objects in the API.

* You can define frames, which are zframe_t objects in the API. Frames
  are sent as separate ZeroMQ frames on the wire. This is ideal for
  variable-size binary data such as images, or other blobs.
  
* You can define ZeroMQ messages, which are zmsg_t objects in the API.
  This is useful for protocols that want to wrap entire ZeroMQ messages
  in other data. If you use a "msg" type field, it must be the last
  field in the message.

<message
    name = "BINARY"
    id = "3"
    digest = "740CAF04158436B4A81B844135A8A1DC9E4F8A54"
    >
    <field name = "flags" type = "octets" size = "4">
        A set of flags
        <test>b38c</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "public key" type = "chunk">
        Our public key
        <test>89f5ffe70d747869dfe8</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "identifier" type = "uuid">
        Unique identity
        <test>3a60e6850a1e4cc15f3bfd4b42bc6b3e</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "address" type = "frame">
        Return address as frame
        <test>0206f99f6137d9fe380f</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "content" type = "msg">

        <test>728a92c6749235ba7002</test>
    </field>
Deliver a multi-part message.
</message>

As well as the built-in types, you can define your own types, by composing
them from other fields:

<message
    name = "TYPES"
    id = "4"
    digest = "DEE674A1BCAC455B7CD1801F4008C65D0A37B2EA"
    >
    <field name = "client" type = "person">
        Client contact
        <test key = "forename">Lucius Junius</test>
        <test key = "surname">Brutus</test>
        <test key = "mobile">01234567890</test>
        <test key = "email">brutus@example.com</test>
    </field>
    <field name = "supplier" type = "person">
        Supplier contact
        <test key = "forename">Leslie</test>
        <test key = "surname">Lamport</test>
        <test key = "mobile">01987654321</test>
        <test key = "email">lamport@example.com</test>
    </field>
Demonstrate custom-defined types
</message>

Here is the custom type. In the BNF, this will express as a separate term,
as you'd expect. In the C API, this will be expressed as atomic properties
prefixed with the original field name, e.g. client_forename, supplier_email.

<type name = "person">
    <field name = "forename" type = "string">Given name</field>
    <field name = "surname" type = "string">Family name</field>
    <field name = "mobile" type = "string">Mobile phone number</field>
    <field name = "email" type = "string">Email address</field>
</type>

</class>
